This is me, I'm a software engineer. I have a special interest in Backend API Design and development, databases, and also some frontend works. 

I love to live with Communication Protocols, Web Servers, Database Engineering, Proxies, Web Framework Runtime, and Message formats. 

I've built, launched, and maintained web services, and have learned many lessons along the way. I'm flexible, proactive, and curious. I believe in the craft of software engineering.

I love tackling challenges and I enjoy writing about them. I occasionally make myself available for contract work and consultancy.
